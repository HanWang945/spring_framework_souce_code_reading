 * 简单的FactoryBean实现，也就是不实现当前这个扩展接口，则如果他们的isSingleton()方法实现返回false.就只认为总是返回独立的实例，并且只有在需要的情况下访问暴露对象
 * <p>Plain {@link FactoryBean} implementations which do not implement
 * this extended interface are simply assumed to always return independent

 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for
 * internal use within the framework and within collaborating frameworks.
 * 通常，应用程序提供的FactoryBean应该仅仅实现简单的FactoryBean接口。新的方法可能被添加到这个扩展接口,即使是在点发布中
 * In general, application-provided FactoryBeans should simply implement
 * the plain {@link FactoryBean} interface. New methods might be added
 * to this extended interface even in point releases.
